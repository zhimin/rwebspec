rWebUnit is a ruby version of thoughtwork's open source jWebUnit, which 'facilitates creation of
acceptance tests for web applications'.

rWebUnit wraps the popular web testing framework: WATIR  (jWebUnit depends on HttpUnit).
Because underlying technologies are different (HttpUnit simulates a browser, Watir drives IE), rWebUnit does
not support full jWebUnit API.  

For example, 
  jWebUnit: checkCheckBox("name", "new_value") can set new value for a checkbox, but rWebUnit/Watir can't.
On the other hand, HttpUnit has limited support of Javascript, You don't need to worry about it in Watir.

Here are reasons you might want to try rWebUnit instead of using Watir directly.

  * already familar with jWebUnit framework (arguably, more readable tests)
  * want to use WebTest - Page framework to design your tests (look at sample\kongming_webtest.rb)
  * want to use a high level of API beyond specific framework: WATIR
  * utilize common test methods included in rWebUnit (like getToday ...)
  
TODO:
====
  * file upload (waiting for Watir 2.0?)
  * script to convert jWebUnit -> rWebUnit, and vice versa.
  
FAQ:
===
1. How can I run rWebUnit tests without showing IE window?

A: This is really a WATIR question. Append '-b' option your command.
   Example: ruby hide_webtest.rb -b
